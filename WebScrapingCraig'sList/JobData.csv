The Johnson O’Connor Research Foundation is dedicated to helping people of all ages (from high school to retirement) learn about their natural talents to discover work that is both satisfying and a natural fit. An aptitude consultant administers hands-on, timed tests and explains the results to clients to help with educational and career decisions.

The starting salary is $54,000.  We offer paid vacation, sick days, and generous full benefits (health/dental/vision insurance and a 403b retirement plan).  We are in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood. 

Our national organization is committed to the well-being of its employees.  We support staff enjoying life outside of work.  Our hours are Monday through Friday, 8:45 am to 5:00 pm, and there is no last minute or evening/weekend work required.   All test administration must be done in person using our physical test instruments, so we are unable to offer remote work options during the training period for test administrators; subsequently, one or two days a week can be remote. Most of our clients hear about us through word-of-mouth referral and no direct sales is required.

As this is a client-facing role, proof of Covid vaccination (or valid medical or religious exemption) is required.

Who we’re looking for:

You have at minimum a bachelor’s degree. No specific major is required, but psychology, career and educational counseling, sociology, and higher education administration are a plus, as is a year or more of professional work experience.  

You are intellectually curious and enjoy learning about people and the world of work.

You enjoy communicating with a wide range of people in a patient and encouraging manner.

You are comfortable moving quickly through testing, scoring, paperwork and counseling within set timeframes.  You can take in, synthesize, and interpret information quickly.

You are conscientious, showing care for both your team members (punctual, reliable, eager to help wherever needed) and for quality of services provided (minimizing mistakes, following research protocols. presenting test results positively).

You are comfortable with a small, close-knit work environment (you would be working with the current director and one other aptitude consultant), but you will be meeting new clients nearly every day.

You are interested in staying long enough in the position to fully implement your knowledge and skills (prefer 1 year or longer).

You are motivated to take on management responsibilities. Directorship of the office is an eventual possibility for the right candidate.

Daily Responsibilities:

•	Administer aptitude tests using a standardized script and hands-on props, many of which are timed.
•	Score tests and enter information into a database quickly and accurately. Answer phone calls and emails with questions from potential clients and schedule appointments.
•	Regularly meet with clients and their family members to explain their test results.  Many clients find this knowledge to be life-changing for them!

This is primarily a testing and advising role and not a research role. Our research department hires separately for research positions. We offer full training on administration of our own proprietary battery of aptitude tests, and on interpretation of the results. You can find more information about the Foundation and aptitude testing on our website: www.jocrf.org.

If this job sounds like something you’d love to do every day, we definitely want to hear from you!

Please, NO phone calls.  Interested applicants should send a cover letter (required) and resume via this link: https://jocrf.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=50&source=aWQ9OA%3D%3D

The clinicians and their teams will work to help our shelter guests acclimate to the challenging shelter environment and to engage in community-based services that will support recovery and resiliency and a pathway to housing.

Outreach and engagement is a significant function of the role as accessibility, consistency and collaboration are basic principles of care in order to engage guests in services.

For guests who are transient in that they move from shelter to shelter or from shelter to street and back, the clinician will work with the PSI Outreach Program to ensure guest safety and continuity of care.

The clinician will work in collaboration with other MATCH Teams across the shelter system to ensure coordination of care and avoid duplication of services as well. The clinician will work collaboratively and directly with DMH, HOT and BEST to bring together the needed resources in the most effective way, building on guests’ strengths while utilizing the least restrictive environments and methods.
