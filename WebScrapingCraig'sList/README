Dear Reader,
This is my attempt to scrape job application data from a website called "Craig's List". 
I have done by using 3 python libraries:
     1. BeautifulSoup
     2. Requests
     3. Pandas
I've then recorded 100 job application data into a .CSV file the webdata scraped which is also uploaded in this repository.
