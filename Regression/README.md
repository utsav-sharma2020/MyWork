Hello Reader,
This is my first Linear Regression Program coded in Python primarily  using sklearn library of the python documentation. I have also uploaded the testing dataset i used which is supremely simplistic since this is my first attempt at this.

Athough the best part about this code is that it I have tried to make it soo generic which will aid in making other regression models with the same code with just a few changes...
